2          129.6.15.28          192.168.142.128.       TCP            [SYN, ACK] Seq = 0, Ack = 1
3.         192.168.142.128.     129.6.15.28.           TCP            [ACK] Seq = 1, Ack = 1

Remainder frames are NOT part of the TCP handshake:

5.         192.168.142.128      129.6.15.28.           TCP            [FIN, ACK] Seq = 1, Ack = 53
6.         129.6.15.28          192.168.142.128.       TCP            [ACK] Seq = 53, Ack = 2

2. The client is using port number 13. 

3. The client needs a port because the port number is associated with a particular server. In order for a request and response to take place, a connection between the client and a server needs to take place through specifying a port number.

4.   129.6.15.28.  192.168.142.128. DAYTIME.  DAYTIME RESPONSE

5. The frame includes information about the time it took to get to that frame. It states that this frame is of type 'response'. It also states that it's the UTC(NIST) time. 

6. [SYN] is the control bit/flag that initiates the TCP connection / three-way handshake between the client and server. Both the client and server will have this flag set to 1.

7. [ACK] is the packet that signifies if the destination address received information from the source address. 

8. [FIN] is the flag that is sent when the TCP connection has ended / when the client requests that the connection be closed because it doesn't have any more information to send. 

9. The nc client because the source address is not the one associated with the time server. 

===== HTTP =====

1. 2 TCP connections were opened because the client, my computer, sent two [SYN] packets to the server/destination address.

2. On the following frame, my computer sends a GET request for the index.html.

5	0.051394320	192.168.142.128	  45.79.89.123	 HTTP	 408	GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 

3. On the following frame, my computer sends a GET request for jeff_square_head.jpg.

11	0.386580582	192.168.142.128  45.79.89.123	HTTP	 377	GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1
